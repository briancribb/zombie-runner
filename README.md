<h1>Zombie Runner</h1>
<p>This was a chance for me to play around with kinematics and do some groovy canvas animation. I had originally planned to make this into a game, but things can slow down once you have a few runners on the screen.</p>
<p>I've tabled it for now, but I plan to make something similar with CreateJS at some future point.</p>
